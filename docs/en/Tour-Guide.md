# Tour Guide Management

Tour guides are a key component in enhancing the customer’s travel experience. Through the admin system, you can add guide profiles, manage their language qualifications, and prepare for future order assignments. This module will guide you through creating and maintaining guide information.

## Create a Tour Guide

In the admin sidebar, go to the `Tour Guides` page and click `Create New`. Fill in the required guide information and upload the necessary documents:

- Tour guide license
- Guide photo
- Guide email address
- Language qualification certificates

After creating a guide, you can edit the details by clicking the `Edit` option in the table under the `Actions` column.

## Guide Languages

Guide language refers to the working language used by the tour guide to communicate with and explain to guests speaking a specific language.

When customers book a tour on the website, they can choose their preferred guide language. Once the order is generated, you can view the language requirement in the **Order Management** section of the admin panel and assign a guide with the appropriate language skills.

For detailed steps, please refer to [Assigning Tour Guides](Arrange-Tour-Guide.md).

Please ensure that guide information is accurate and complete—especially **language skills** and **certification documents**—to enable efficient matching during order processing.
